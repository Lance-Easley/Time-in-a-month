# Side Project
This is my repository for the "Time in a Month" project I made during Base Camp Coding Academy.

## Time-in-a-month
This was my first side project. 
I came up with it after going through an example Nate did in the terminal to find the number of hours in a month. 
I took this concept and added the ability to look up weeks, days, hours, minutes, or seconds. 
Iff the user asks for February, then the program asks for the year to determine if it is leap year February or not.
